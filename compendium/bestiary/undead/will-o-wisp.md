## Traits

***Consume Life.*** As a bonus action, the will-o'-wisp can target one creature it can see within 5 feet of it that has 0 hit points and is still alive. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw against this magic or die. If the target dies, the will-o'-wisp regains 10 (`3d6`) hit points.

***Ephemeral.*** The will-o'-wisp can't wear or carry anything.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The will-o'-wisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Variable Illumination.*** The will-o'-wisp sheds bright light in a 5 to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of ft. equal to the chosen radius. The will-o'-wisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.

## Actions

***Shock.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (`2d8`) lightning damage.

***Invisibility.*** The will-o'-wisp and its light magically become [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) until it attacks or uses its Consume Life, or until its [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
