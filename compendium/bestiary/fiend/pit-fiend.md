## Traits

***Fear Aura.*** Any creature hostile to the pit fiend that starts its turn within 20 feet of the pit fiend must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, unless the pit fiend is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). On a failed save, the creature is [frightened](rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the pit fiend's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The pit fiend has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The pit fiend's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The pit fiend's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21). The pit fiend can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [fireball](compendium/spells/fireball.md)

**3/day each**: [hold monster](compendium/spells/hold-monster.md), [wall of fire](compendium/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The pit fiend makes four attacks: one with its bite, one with its claw, one with its mace, and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`4d6 + 8`) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned). While [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) slashing damage.

***Mace.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (`6d6`) fire damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`3d10 + 8`) bludgeoning damage.
