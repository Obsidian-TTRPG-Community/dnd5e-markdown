## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The marilith has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The marilith's weapon attacks are magical.

***Reactive.*** The marilith can take one reaction on every turn in combat.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The marilith can make seven attacks: six with its longswords and one with its tail.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), the marilith can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the marilith can't make tail attacks against other targets.

***Teleport.*** The marilith magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The marilith adds 5 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the marilith must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
