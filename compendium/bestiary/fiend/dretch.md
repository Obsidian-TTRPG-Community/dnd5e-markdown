## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`2d4`) slashing damage.

***Fetid Cloud (1/Day).*** A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of its next turn. While [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.
