## Traits

***Elemental Demise.*** If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md), [thunderwave](compendium/spells/thunderwave.md)

**1/day each**: [conjure elemental](compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) ([air elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) only), [creation](compendium/spells/creation.md), [gaseous form](compendium/spells/gaseous-form.md), [invisibility](compendium/spells/invisibility.md), [major image](compendium/spells/major-image.md), [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md)

**3/day each**: [create food and water](compendium/spells/create-food-and-water.md) (can create wine instead of water), [tongues](compendium/spells/tongues.md), [wind walk](compendium/spells/wind-walk.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage plus 3 (`1d6`) lightning or thunder damage (djinni's choice).

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
