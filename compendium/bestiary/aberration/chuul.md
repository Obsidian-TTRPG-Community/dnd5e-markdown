## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the [detect magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell but isn't itself magical.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. The target is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled).

***Tentacles.*** One creature [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
