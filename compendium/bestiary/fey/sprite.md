## Actions

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target falls [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for the same duration, or until it takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

***Heart Sight.*** The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment. Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

***Invisibility.*** The sprite magically turns [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is [invisible](rules/conditions.md#invisible) with it.
