## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage plus 3 (`1d6`) acid damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

***Acid Spray (Recharge 6).*** The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled). Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
