## Traits

***Standing Leap.*** The bulette's long jump is up to 30 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`4d12 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Deadly Leap.*** If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) and take 14 (`3d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (`3d6 + 4`) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone), and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) in the bulette's space.
