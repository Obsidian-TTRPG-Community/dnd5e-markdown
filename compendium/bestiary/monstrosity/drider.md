## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drider has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put the drider to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The drider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drider has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Web Walker.*** The drider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drider's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13). The drider can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](compendium/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](compendium/spells/faerie-fire.md)

## Actions

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or 8 (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.
