## Traits

***Trampling Charge.*** If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). If the target is [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone), the gorgon can make one attack with its hooves against it as a bonus action.

## Actions

***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d12 + 5`) piercing damage.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The gorgon exhales petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained). The [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [petrified](rules/conditions.md#petrified) until freed by the  [greater restoration](compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other magic.
