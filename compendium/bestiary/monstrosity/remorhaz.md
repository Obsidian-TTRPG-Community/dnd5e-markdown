## Traits

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`6d10 + 7`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the remorhaz can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).
