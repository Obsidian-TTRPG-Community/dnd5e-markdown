## Traits

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The wolf has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The wolf has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Snow Camouflage.*** The wolf has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The wolf exhales a blast of freezing wind in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
