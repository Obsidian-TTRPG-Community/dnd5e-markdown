## Traits

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The rug is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) while in the area of an [antimagic field](compendium/spells/antimagic-field.md). If targeted by [dispel magic](compendium/spells/dispel-magic.md), the rug must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute.

***Damage Transfer.*** While it is grappling a creature, the rug takes only half the damage dealt to it, and the creature [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the rug takes the other half.

***False Appearance.*** While the rug remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal rug.

## Actions

***Smother.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* The creature is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded), and at risk of suffocating, and the rug can't smother another target. In addition, at the start of each of the target's turns, the target takes 10 (`2d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage.
