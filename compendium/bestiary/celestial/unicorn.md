## Traits

***Charge.*** If the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (`2d8`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Magic Resistance.*** The unicorn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The unicorn's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The unicorn's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [druidcraft](compendium/spells/druidcraft.md), [pass without trace](compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md)

**1/day each**: [calm emotions](compendium/spells/calm-emotions.md), [dispel evil and good](compendium/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [entangle](compendium/spells/entangle.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The unicorn makes two attacks: one with its hooves and one with its horn.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Horn.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Healing Touch (3/Day).*** The unicorn touches another creature with its horn. The target magically regains 11 (`2d8 + 2`) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

***Teleport (1/Day).*** The unicorn magically teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location the unicorn is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.

## Legendary Actions

***Hooves.*** The unicorn makes one attack with its hooves.

***Shimmering Shield (Costs 2 Actions).*** The unicorn creates a shimmering, magical field around itself or another creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC until the end of the unicorn's next turn.

***Heal Self (Costs 3 Actions).*** The unicorn magically regains 11 (`2d8 + 2`) hit points.

## Regional effects

Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:

- Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.  
- Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity ([Stealth](rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.  
- When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.  
- Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.  

If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.
