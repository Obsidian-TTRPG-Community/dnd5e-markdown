## Traits

***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) cold damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (`10d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
