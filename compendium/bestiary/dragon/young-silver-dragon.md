## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

- **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
