## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

- **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (`12d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 5 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
