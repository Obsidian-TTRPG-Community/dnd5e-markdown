## Traits

***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Engulf.*** The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature [grappled](rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it. The engulfed target is [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded), [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained), and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
