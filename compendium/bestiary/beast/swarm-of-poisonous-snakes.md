## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 7 (`2d6`) piercing damage, or 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
