## Traits

***Keen Smell.*** The lion has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The lion has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Pounce.*** If the lion moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone). If the target is [prone](rules/conditions.md#prone), the lion can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.
