## Traits

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (`2d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.
