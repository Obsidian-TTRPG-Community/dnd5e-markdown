# Chains of Carceri
*Source: SRD / Basic Rules* 

You can cast [hold monster](compendium/spells/hold-monster.md) at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
