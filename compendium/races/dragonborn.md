### Breath Weapon

You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes `2d6` damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to `3d6` at 6th level, `4d6` at 11th level, and `5d6` at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Damage Resistance

You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
