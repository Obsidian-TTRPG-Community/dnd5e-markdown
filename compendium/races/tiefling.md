### Darkvision

Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Infernal Legacy

You know the [thaumaturgy](compendium/spells/thaumaturgy.md) cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [hellish rebuke](compendium/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) spell as a 2nd-level spell with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the [darkness](compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell once per day with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest.
