# Personality Traits

`dice: [](personality-traits.md#^personality-traits)`

| Personality Traits |
|--------------------|
| I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |
| I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. |
| I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. |
| I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen. |
| Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. |
| I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. |
| I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me. |
| I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example. |
