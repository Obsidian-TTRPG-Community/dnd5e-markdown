# Flaws

`dice: [](flaws.md#^flaws)`

| Flaws |
|-------|
| I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy. |
| My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. |
| I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. |
| dice: d6 | Flaw |
| Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |
| I am inflexible in my thinking. |
| I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. |
