# Bonds

`dice: [](bonds.md#^bonds)`

| Bonds |
|-------|
| I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. |
| I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic. |
| I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died. |
| I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy. |
| dice: d6 | Bond |
| I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago. |
| Everything I do is for the common people. |
