This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [cure wounds](compendium/spells/cure-wounds.md) (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [lesser restoration](compendium/spells/lesser-restoration.md) (2 charges). or [mass cure wounds](compendium/spells/mass-cure-wounds.md) (5 charges).

The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
