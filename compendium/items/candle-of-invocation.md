This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the [detect evil and good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

| dice: d20 | Alignment |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Chaotic evil |
| 3-4 | Chaotic neutral |
| 5-7 | Chaotic good |
| 8-9 | Neutral evil |
| 10-11 | Neutral |
| 12-13 | Neutral good |
| 14-15 | Lawful evil |
| 16-17 | Lawful neutral |
| 18-20 | Lawful good |

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the [gate](compendium/spells/gate.md) spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
