# Ring of Djinni Summoning
*Ring, major, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) from the Elemental Plane of Air. The [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.

While summoned, the [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.

After the [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the [djinni](compendium/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) dies.
