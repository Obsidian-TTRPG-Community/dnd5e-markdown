# Wind Fan
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the [gust of wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a cumulative 20% chance chance of not working and tearing into useless, nonmagical tatters.
