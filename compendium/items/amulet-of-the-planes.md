While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the [plane shift](compendium/spells/plane-shift.md) spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a `d100`. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.
