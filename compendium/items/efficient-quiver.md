# Efficient Quiver
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty [arrows](compendium/items/arrow.md), [bolts](compendium/items/crossbow-bolt.md), or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen [javelins](compendium/items/javelin.md) or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, [quarterstaffs](compendium/items/quarterstaff.md), or [spears](compendium/items/spear.md).

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
