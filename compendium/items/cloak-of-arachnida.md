This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to poison damage.  
- You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.  
- You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.  
- You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.  
- You can use an action to cast the [web](compendium/spells/web.md) spell (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn.
