# Gem of Brightness
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.  
- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [blinded](rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.  

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
