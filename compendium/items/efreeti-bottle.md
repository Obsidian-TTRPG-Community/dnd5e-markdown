# Efreeti Bottle
*Wondrous Item, major, very rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls to determine what happens.

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01-10 | The [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 11-90 | The [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 91-00 | The [efreeti](compendium/bestiary/elemental/efreeti.md) can cast the [wish](compendium/spells/wish.md) spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |
