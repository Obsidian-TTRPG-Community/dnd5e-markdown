# Tinderbox
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 5 sp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
