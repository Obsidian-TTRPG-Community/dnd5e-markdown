# Potion of Growth
*Potion, minor, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [enlarge/reduce](compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for `1d4` hours (no [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
