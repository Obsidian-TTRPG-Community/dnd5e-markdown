This poison is typically made only by the [drow](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/drow.md), and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [unconscious](rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while [poisoned](rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
