# Acid (vial)
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 25 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes `2d6` acid damage.
