## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [identify](compendium/spells/identify.md) spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [remove curse](compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage.
