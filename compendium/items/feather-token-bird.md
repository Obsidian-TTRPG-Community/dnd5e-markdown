# Feather Token, Bird
*Wondrous Item, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect.

## Bird

You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a [roc](compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/roc.md), but it obeys your simple commands and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day. with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.
