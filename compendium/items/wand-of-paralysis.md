# Wand of Paralysis
*Wand, major, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
