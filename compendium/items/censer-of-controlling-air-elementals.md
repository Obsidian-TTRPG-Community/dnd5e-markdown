# Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
*Wondrous Item, major, rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak the censer's command word and summon an [air elemental](compendium/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md), as if you had cast the [conjure elemental](compendium/spells/conjure-elemental.md) spell. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
