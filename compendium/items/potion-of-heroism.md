# Potion of Heroism
*Potion, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [bless](compendium/spells/bless.md) spell (no [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.
