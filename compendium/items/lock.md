# Lock
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 10 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with [thieves' tools](compendium/items/thieves-tools.md) can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your DM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.
