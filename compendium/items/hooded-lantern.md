# Hooded Lantern
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
