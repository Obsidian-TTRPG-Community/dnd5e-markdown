# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [detect thoughts](compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [detect thoughts](compendium/spells/detect-thoughts.md), you can use an action to cast the [suggestion](compendium/spells/suggestion.md) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
