# Eyes of Charming
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the [charm person](compendium/spells/charm-person.md) spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.
