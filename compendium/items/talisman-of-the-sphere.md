When you make an Intelligence ([Arcana](rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to control a [sphere of annihilation](compendium/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md) while you are holding this talisman, you double your proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn with control over a [sphere of annihilation](compendium/items/sphere-of-annihilation.md), you can use an action to levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your Intelligence modifier.
