# Wand of Magic Missiles
*Wand, major, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [magic missile](compendium/spells/magic-missile.md) spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
