# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, major, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: Requires Attunement
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be [paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) or [restrained](rules/conditions.md#restrained).
