A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to `3d8` + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/classes/bard.md), [Cleric](compendium/classes/cleric.md), [Druid](compendium/classes/druid.md)
