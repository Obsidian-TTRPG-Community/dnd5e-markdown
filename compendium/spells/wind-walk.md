# Wind Walk
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, fire and holy water
- **Duration:** 8 hour

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the [Dash](rules/actions.md#Dash) action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

**Classes**: [Druid](compendium/classes/druid.md)
