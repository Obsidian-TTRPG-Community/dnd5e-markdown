# Giant Insect
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede becomes a [giant centipede](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-centipede.md), a spider becomes a [giant spider](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md), a wasp becomes a [giant wasp](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-wasp.md), and a scorpion becomes a [giant scorpion](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md).

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The DM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a [giant wasp](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-wasp.md).

**Classes**: [Druid](compendium/classes/druid.md)
