- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.

## Concentration
_Source: SRD / Basic Rules_

Some spells require you to maintain [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) in order to keep their magic active. If you lose [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration), such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration), that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration). The following factors can break [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration):

- **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on a spell if you cast another spell that requires [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration). You can't concentrate on two spells at once.  
- **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration). The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.  
- **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on a spell if you are [incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or if you die.  

The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain [concentration](rules/conditions.md#concentration) on a spell.

## Deafened
_Source: SRD / Basic Rules_

- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.  

## Exhaustion
_Source: SRD / Basic Rules_

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

| Level | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Disadvantage on ability checks |
| 2 | Speed halved |
| 3 | Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws |
| 4 | Hit point maximum halved |
| 5 | Speed reduced to 0 |
| 6 | Death |
^level-effect

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Also, being raised from the dead reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1.
