# Damage Types
*Source: SRD / Basic Rules* 

## Acid

The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

## Bludgeoning

Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

## Cold

The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

## Fire

Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

## Force

Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.

## Lightning

A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.

## Necrotic

Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.

## Piercing

Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

## Poison

Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.

## Psychic

Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.

## Radiant

Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

## Slashing

Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

## Thunder

A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.
