# DnD 5e SRD in Markdown

The Dnd5e SRD in Markdown for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Also, a place for 5e Homebrew items. 

> Inspired by [@OldManUmby](https://github.com/OldManUmby)'s infamous 5e SRD Repository, this 5E repository serves more as an example for our SRD project on how to build a works-for-most-everyone vault for our Sourcerer team. While it can be used as an SRD base, please check out Old Man Umby's 5e SRD wiki first. 

## How to Use

Clone, Fork, or use download the repository as a zip. Open folder in Obsidian, and you are good to go!

## Homebrew?

Yes! we allow and encourage 5e Homebrew that is ready to go.
